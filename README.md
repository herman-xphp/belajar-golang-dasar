# Basic Go Learning Project

This is a project for learning the basics of the Go (Golang) programming language.

## How to Run

To run an example file, use the following command:

```
go run filename.go
```

It is not recommended to use `go build` because there are multiple files with a `main` function in this folder. This project is intended only for learning and exploring basic Go features.

## Notes

- Each `.go` file contains example code with a different `main` function.
- Run each file individually as needed.
- This project is not intended for production use, only for practice and learning Go fundamentals.
